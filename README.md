### Archive Notice
This plugin is relatively stable and feature-complete, but I won't be working on it or accepting pull requests going forward. If anyone is interested in taking over as maintainer, feel free to email me. I'm also happy to link to popular forks that have spun off. Thanks.

# New Version Plugin 🎉

A Flutter plugin that makes it possible to: 
* Check if a user has the most recent version of your app installed.
* Show the user an alert with a link to the appropriate app store page.

See more at the [Dart Packages page.](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/new_version)

## Installation
Add new_version as [a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.](https://flutter.io/using-packages/)
```
dependencies:
  new_version: ^0.3.0
```

## Usage
In `main.dart` (or wherever your app is initialized), create an instance of `NewVersion`.

`final newVersion = NewVersion();`

The plugin will automatically use your Flutter package identifier to check the app store. If your app has a different identifier in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, you can overwrite this by providing values for `androidId` and/or `iOSId`.

*For iOS:* If your app is only available outside the U.S. App Store, you will need to set `iOSAppStoreCountry` to the two-letter country code of the store you want to search. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 for a list of ISO Country Codes.

You can then use the plugin in two ways.

### Quickstart
Calling `showAlertIfNecessary` with your app's `BuildContext` will check if the app can be updated, and will automatically display a platform-specific alert that the user can use to go to the app store.

`newVersion.showAlertIfNecessary(context: context);`

### Advanced 😎
If you want to create a custom alert or use the app version information differently, call `getVersionStatus`. This will return a `Future<VersionStatus>` with information about the local and app store versions of the app.
```
final status = await newVersion.getVersionStatus();
status.canUpdate // (true)
status.localVersion // (1.2.1)
status.storeVersion // (1.2.3)
status.appStoreLink // (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942?mt=8)
```

If you want to present a customized dialog, you can pass your `VersionStatus` to `showUpdateDialog()`.
```
newVersion.showUpdateDialog(
  context: context, 
  versionStatus: status,
  dialogTitle: 'Custom dialog title',
  dialogText: 'Custom dialog text',
  updateButtonText: 'Custom update button text',
  dismissButtonText: 'Custom dismiss button text',
  dismissAction: () => functionToRunAfterDialogDismissed(),
)
```
